# The round trip: the plugin announces a review and waits, the app writes a
# decision, the plugin wakes up and produces what the agent will read.
#
#   Support/test-review.sh
#
# Everything here is the real code on both sides. The decision is written by
# Review.decide — the function the toolbar buttons call — rather than by a
# click, because posting a synthetic click needs accessibility permission that a
# terminal does not have. That one hop, button to selector, is the only part of
# this feature no test covers.
#
# Every case gets its own IMARK_PENDING_DIR, so the suite cannot touch a real
# review that happens to be open, and two cases cannot touch each other.
