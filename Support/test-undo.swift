// The build and the -I are not optional: Sources/Imark imports ImarkRender by
// module, so without the built modules on the search path this does not compile
// at all. release.sh has always run it that way; this comment did not, and said
// so for long enough that following it looked like the test was broken.
//
// Undo is the only thing in Imark that writes a whole file at once. Everything
// else edits a range of lines and checks the file first. That makes it the one
// place where a mistake costs somebody a document rather than a comment, and it
// had two: the snapshot went back to whichever file the window happened to be
// showing, and it went back over an outside edit without a word.
//
// Most of it exercises the stack directly, which is where the rules live. The
// last case goes the whole way through a real window — a real comment, a real
// navigation, the real selector ⌘Z fires — because a correct model wired up
// wrongly is still a lost document.
